# MarkTracker

"Mark Tracker" is a GUI desktop application that shows the structure of an assessment tasks, in terms of its components. These components are defined by the assessment task type - for example, if the assessment is a quiz, then a component could be a question, or a sub-question. 

With each assessment task, and each associated components, the application is also able to show marks achieved by students. For the assessment task, the application can display some statistics related to this matter: average mark, best done component, and mark distribution.

The application also allows users to preserve feedback. This feedback can be related to the assessment, components, or the student for that assessment. For the latter, the application allows users to preserve feedback for each student for EACH component in the assessment task.

## Possible Improvements
* Single context menu strips for both assessment panel and participation panel nodes.
Note this will require manually disabling menu items (eg when right-clicking a course, adding a component should be disabled).

* Include a "select" menu item in context menu strips that selects the node.
